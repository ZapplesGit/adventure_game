# Outsider's Odyssey - The Island

"""
Brief:
"Outsider's Odyssey - The Island": The player wakes up, finding themselves stranded on a desert island inhabited by a
mysterious and isolated tribe. The tribe is distrustful of outsiders, and the main progression of the game should be
for the protagonist to uncover the secrets of the tribe, and why how they can escape the island.

The player must learn to survive on the island, hunting and gathering for food and resources, while also avoiding
dangerous predators / monsters, and natural hazards. As the player explores the island and progresses the story, they will
uncover clues and puzzles that reveal the tribe's secrets, ultimately leading to a confrontation with the tribe's
leadership.

Additionally, the player must contend with the limited resources available on the island, managing their inventory and crafting
tools and weapons in order to survive and progress.
